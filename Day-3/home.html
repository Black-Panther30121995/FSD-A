                <p>Pollution is a term which even kids are aware of these days. It has become so common that almost
                    everyone acknowledges the fact that pollution is rising continuously. The term ‘pollution’ means
                    the manifestation of any unsolicited foreign substance in something. When we talk about pollution
                    on earth, we refer to the contamination that is happening of the natural resources by various
                    pollutants. All this is mainly caused by human activities which harm the environment in ways more
                    than one. Therefore, an urgent need has arisen to tackle this issue straightaway. That is to say,
                    pollution is damaging our earth severely and we need to realize its effects and prevent this damage.
                    In this essay on pollution, we will see what are the effects of pollution and how to reduce it.
